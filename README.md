### **Descriptive and Diagnostic Analysis**  

I have worked on a small project focusing on the **first two stages of data analysis: Descriptive and Diagnostic Analysis.**  

**Dataset:** This dataset contains information on households worldwide that have adopted renewable energy sources such as **wind, solar, hydro, biomass, and geothermal.**  

This analysis highlights how **Descriptive and Diagnostic Analysis alone** can provide valuable insights and guide future recommendations.  

Additionally, I conducted **hypothesis testing** to examine whether **monthly energy usage** varies significantly across different **income levels (Low/Medium/High) for each year.**  
- For **most years (2020, 2021, 2023, 2024),** there was **no significant difference** in usage across income levels.  
- **Only in 2022**, a statistically significant difference was observed, likely due to the **COVID-19 pandemic** impacting energy consumption patterns.  

To check for **extreme cases of energy consumption**, I also performed **outlier detection using the IQR method**â€”however, no outliers were found.
